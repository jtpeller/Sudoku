# Sudoku
 Sudoku game written in Java

## What
 Work-in-progress Sudoku game written in Java.

## Known Issues
- Text display issue (the numbers don't show up)
- Sudoku lines display on the wrong layer (sometimes behind the grid)
- Difficulties vary widely

## Other problems
- There is no reason for options (there isn't any sound or music yet)
- Images should be separate from the source code
- Difficulty screen should be its own frame

## Other things I want to add/change
- Keyboard shortcuts for the various numbers
- Improve theme
- Improve text. Change fonts and modify the color scheme to make it obvious which value is the user's and which is provided.
- Make generation independent of grid size
- Add a menubar
- Track stats

## How
 You can run this buy executing the included `Sudoku.jar` file.
